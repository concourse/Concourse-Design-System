## Concourse Design System
These guidelines are a means of communicating the guiding principles of how we approach the Concourse product and its design. We are community driven and user centered in our design. Product Design changes are prompted by pain points from usability testing, observation, and feedback from users.


## About
Building this documentation is to ensure consistency in brand, visual, and user interface design as the application grows and changes.
Concourse Design system is always in a state of iteration as we build out new features that evolve the current UI. 

## Global Elements
The Global Elements section standardizes the guidelines, formats and measurements of all general design elements, which form the design
foundation of the product.

### Typography

Inspired by the terminal we use a monospace font in our UI. The majority of IDEs (via a console or terminal) and software text editors use monospaced fonts as their default typeface because the aignment of the letters and the fixed width of each character make it easier for developers to read errors in code. 

**Inconsolata**
Inconsolata is an open-source font created by Raph Levien and released under the SIL Open Font License
It is a humanist monospaced font designed for source code listing, terminal emulators, and similar uses.

## Trademark Guidelines
In addition to our Trademark Guidelines on our [website](https://concourse-ci.org/trademarks.html) this provides some some guidance as to how to use the Concourse logo.

> OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS. The Apache 2.0 license gives you the right to use, copy, distribute and modify the Concourse software. However, open source licenses like the Apache 2.0 license do not address trademarks. Concourse Marks need to be used in a way consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this policy â€“ to help you understand what branding is allowed or required when using our software under the Apache license.

> IMPROPER USE OF THE TRADEMARKS AND LOGOS. Use of the logo is reserved solely for use by Concourse in its unaltered form.

> PROPER USE OF THE CONCOURSE MARKS. We want to encourage a robust community for the Concourse open source project. Therefore, you may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the Concourse brand. In other words, when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a trademark license from us to do them.
