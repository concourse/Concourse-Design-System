## Concourse Design System
We want to start documenting the design system of components and patterns, (very abstract design patterns) to allow the community to contribute more frequently. This repo brings together the UX and UI guidelines, patterns and all that you will need to get started.   

### Contributing
The team welcomes contributions from the community. Please see here for guidelines. (https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
